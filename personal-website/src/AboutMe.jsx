This unique program combines the traditional computer engineering courses (DS&A, OOP, Software Development, Computer Architecture, etc.), complementing a traditional set of mathematics courses (real/complex analysis, probability, stochastic processes, etc.). This combination has provided me with a rigorous mathematical background and a passion for its applications in machine learning and software engineering."}

With QMIND I have participated in machine learning research and development projects. Last year, I worked on a crypto-currency arbitrage pathfinding project, and I am currently researching applications of mechanistic interpretability. I have also been a long-standing member of the Commerce and Engineering Environmental Conference (CEEC). CEEC is Canada's largest undergraduate sustainability conference. Most recently, I was the sponsorship director, leading a team of 4 coordinators."}

I have been participating in, and later guiding, wilderness canoe trips for over 10 years. The greatest of which was a 52-day journey through Canadaâ€™s Arctic. Canoe tripping has instilled initiative, collaborative skills and a sense of adventure that has benefitted all aspects of my life."}
